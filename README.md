# NextJS Working on WEB mantaining the Mobile version at the same Project!

When you have a mobile project based on Web Development (Capacitor Like project, but can be with another framework) and you want to use NextJS in the Web version and keep the mobile version functional you'll need to to some adjustments. This is because you need to make routing work and generate the build files that feeds the Capacitor webview.

This is a repo that does this with efficiency and can be used as a boilerplate for other projects that want to migrate to NextJS and keep the mobile version in the same repo.


# For Mobile:

Run the following commands in order to run the mobile version:

```bash
npx next build
npx next export
npx cap sync
npx cap open android (or ios)
```

# For WEB:

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
